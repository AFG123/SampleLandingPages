                    Hello Everyone! My Name is Aryan Damai, Born in Jairampur, Arunachal Pradesh, on October 27, 2002,
                    my journey traversed across different
                    terrains. Early on, alongside my mom, I relocated to Shillong due to my father's defense service. I
                    completed my 10th grade at Kendriya Vidyalaya Laitkor Peak, Shillong, securing 69% in 2018. Later, I
                    returned to my true hometown in Assam, where I pursued my 12th grade in the science stream at
                    Margherita College, achieving a 60% score in 2020. The quest for my career path led me to a
                    realizationâ€”I thrive in practical domains. With a knack for computers and mobile devices, I embarked
                    on a BSc in Information Technology. Graduating in 2023 with a commendable 70%, I honed skills in
                    Java, became a certified Android developer, and contributed to several projects encompassing Machine
                    Learning and web development.
